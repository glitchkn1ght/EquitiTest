# EquitiTest

# Design Considerations
- I didn't add try/catch blocks into the CustomerRetrieval class itself as different clients might want to implement different kinds of error catching. 
- I considered adding a logger to capture when orders had null orderdates or null customers but thought it might be going beyond the intended scope of the exercise.
- Originally i had a seperate method for calculating the previous date as i wanted to take leap years into account. However this proved unneccessary as AddYears 
  already does it.
- As the spec doesn't specify an exact type i decided to pass/return IEnumerable for more flexibility.
